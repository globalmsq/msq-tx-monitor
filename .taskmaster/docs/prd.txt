# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Blockchain Transaction Monitoring System

**Document Version**: 3.0
**Created**: September 16, 2025

---

# Overview

The Blockchain Transaction Monitoring System is a real-time web-based dashboard that provides live monitoring and analytics for specific token transactions on the Polygon network.

**Problem**: Token project managers, traders, and community stakeholders need immediate visibility into token activities but currently rely on fragmented tools with delayed data. Existing blockchain explorers lack real-time capabilities and specialized monitoring for specific tokens, making it difficult to spot important market movements or trading patterns as they happen.

**Solution**: A dedicated real-time monitoring platform that tracks four specific tokens (SUT, MSQ, KWT, P2UC) with live transaction feeds, instant analytics updates, and interactive visualizations that refresh automatically as new transactions occur on the blockchain.

**Target Users**:
- Token project managers needing live circulation oversight
- Cryptocurrency traders requiring immediate market intelligence
- Community managers seeking real-time transparent reporting
- Security analysts monitoring for suspicious activities in real-time

**Value Proposition**: Transform blockchain data into immediate actionable insights through live transaction monitoring, real-time analytics, and interactive dashboards that update automatically, enabling instant awareness of market movements and trading patterns without delays or manual refreshing.

# Core Features

## Real-time Transaction Monitoring
**What it does**: Continuously monitors Polygon network for Transfer events of target tokens, capturing transaction details within seconds of occurrence and streaming them to the dashboard with immediate anomaly detection.

**Why it's important**: Provides immediate visibility into market activity, large transfers, and trading patterns while enabling real-time detection of suspicious or unusual transaction behaviors that could indicate security issues or market manipulation.

**How it works**: WebSocket connections to multiple Polygon RPC providers detect Transfer events, validate transaction data, apply real-time anomaly detection algorithms, and stream updates with risk indicators to all connected users.

## Address Analytics and Statistics
**What it does**: Tracks and analyzes every sending and receiving address across all monitored tokens, calculating comprehensive statistics including transaction amounts, frequencies, patterns, and behavioral profiles with real-time updates.

**Why it's important**: Enables identification of high-volume addresses, unusual activity patterns, and potential security risks by providing detailed insights into address behavior and transaction history across the MSQ Wallet ecosystem.

**How it works**: Real-time data processing pipeline maintains running statistics for each address, calculating metrics like total sent/received amounts, transaction frequency, average transaction size, and behavioral patterns, with sortable rankings and drill-down capabilities.

## Live Analytics Dashboard
**What it does**: Displays comprehensive real-time visualizations including live transaction feeds, volume charts, address activity rankings, and statistical summaries that update automatically as new transactions occur, with integrated anomaly indicators.

**Why it's important**: Centralizes all critical token monitoring information with address-level intelligence in one place, allowing operators to spot trends, identify suspicious addresses, and monitor ecosystem health without switching between tools.

**How it works**: Real-time data processing pipeline aggregates incoming transactions, calculates address statistics on-the-fly, applies anomaly detection, and pushes updates to interactive charts and displays using WebSocket connections.

## Real-time Anomaly Detection
**What it does**: Continuously analyzes transaction patterns, address behaviors, and statistical deviations to identify unusual activities such as abnormal transaction amounts, frequency spikes, or suspicious address interactions in real-time.

**Why it's important**: Enables immediate identification of potential security threats, market manipulation attempts, or system abuse patterns, allowing operators to respond quickly to protect the MSQ Wallet ecosystem.

**How it works**: Machine learning algorithms and statistical analysis engines process incoming transactions against historical patterns, address behavior profiles, and predefined risk criteria, triggering visual alerts and detailed investigation reports for suspicious activities.

## Interactive Filtering and Search
**What it does**: Enables users to filter live transaction feeds and address statistics by multiple criteria including token type, amount ranges, time periods, specific addresses, and anomaly indicators with instant results and browser-based saved preferences.

**Why it's important**: Allows operators to focus on relevant data subsets in real-time, investigate specific addresses or transaction patterns, and customize monitoring views based on operational priorities.

**How it works**: Client-side filtering applies to live data streams with backend database queries for address statistics and historical searches, using optimized indexes for fast results and localStorage for filter presets.

## Address Investigation Tools
**What it does**: Provides detailed analysis capabilities for individual addresses including complete transaction history, statistical profiles, behavioral patterns, risk assessments, and connection analysis with other monitored addresses.

**Why it's important**: Enables thorough investigation of suspicious addresses, understanding of user behavior patterns, and identification of address relationships that could indicate coordinated activities or security risks.

**How it works**: Comprehensive database queries compile address profiles with statistical analysis, pattern recognition algorithms identify behavioral signatures, and graph analysis reveals connections between addresses within the monitored ecosystem.
